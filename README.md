# Morning Algorithms
## Open to all students of Nashville Software School

This is the public GitHub repo for Morning Algorithms at NSS. We meet every weekday at 8:00 am.

All code that we work on in the sessions will be posted here for review. If you are a part of the sessions, feel free to push your own
code and make/request changes. In particular, feel free to add any comments that you find helpful.

### Joining
We have a Slack channel on NSS, Morning-Algorithms-C41. Feel free to message us there, or find me (David Larsen) on Slack.

If you are brand new to algorithms and algorithm complexity, I strongly recommend that you watch some videos about complexity and "Big O" notation.
This will help explain why we use many of the concepts we are learning. Slack me, and I can provide some additional resources.

### Concepts

So far, this repo contains code for the following concepts:

#### [Binary Search](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/blob/master/binary-search/binarySearch.js)
An optimized search to find a value in a sorted array.
#### [Frequency Counter](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/blob/master/frequencyCounter/frequencyCounter.js)
Determine if the values in one array all correspond to squares of those values in a second array. Introduction to the concept
of "Frequency Counters"
#### [Anagram](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/anagram/anagram.js)
Determine if two strings are anagrams of one another using frequency counters.
#### [Binary Search](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/binary-search/binarySearch.js)
Search method to find a value in a sorted array by dividing the array into resultant halves.
#### [Count Unique Values](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/countUniqueValues/countUniqueValues.js)
Count the number of unique values in a sorted array. Introduction to the concept of "Multiple Pointers."
#### [Max Sum](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/maxSum-slidingWindow/maxSum.js)
Given an array, find the subarray of a given size with the highest sum. Demo exercise for the "Sliding Window" concept.
#### [Duplicates](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/duplicates/duplicates.js)
Determine if any duplicates exist in a list of arguments.
#### [Reverse String](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/reverseString/reverseString.js)
Reverse the characters in a string.
#### [Average Pair](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/averagePair/averagePair.js)
See if the average of any pair of numbers in an array matches a target average.
Also completed in [C#](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/csharp/averagepair)
#### [Is A Subsequence](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/isSubsequence/isSubsequence.js)
Determine if all the characters of the first string are present, in order, in a second string.
#### [Min Subarray Length](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/minSubArrayLen/minSubArrayLen.js)
Find the length of the smallest subarray within a given array whose members add to a total greater than or equal to a target integer.
#### [Product of Array](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/productOfArray/productOfArray.js)
Find the product of all numbers within an array using a recursive solution.
#### [Fibonacci](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/fib/fib.js)
Find the nth degree of the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive solution.
#### [Recursive Range](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/recursiveRange/recursiveRange.js)
Find the sum of all numbers from 0 to __n__ using a recursive solution.
#### [Singly Linked Lists](https://github.com/dLars99/Morning-Algorithms/tree/master/linked-list/linked-list.js)
Singly Linked List data structure. Constructor plus methods for push, pop, shift, unshift, get, set, insert, remove, and reverse.
