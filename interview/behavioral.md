# Behavioral Interview Questions
## A compilation

This list is a compilation of behavioral interview questions received by members of this cohort. Feel free to add to this list.
I have attempted to classify the questions in a meaningful manner, though any suggestions are welcome.

### General
- Tell me about yourself
- Why development/NSS/software?
- Where do you want to be in 1 year/5 years/10 years?

### Situational
- Is there a type of team member you would not want to work with
- If you had to work with that type of teammate above, how would you handle it?
- What are your workplace stressors? How do you handle those?
- How would you handle conflicting instructions from two different people?
- If you have a full slate and are told to add another project, and another team member is currently assigned to one project but could work better
    with another, how would you handle that?

### Project-based
- Tell me about a time when you had to get from A to B, and when you got to B, it turned out to me more than you anticipated
- Tell me about the process on <project x>

### Company/Team-based
- What kind of team/company are you hoping to look for?
- Where do you see yourself on a team?
