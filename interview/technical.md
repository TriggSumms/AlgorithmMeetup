# Technical Interview Questions
## A compilation

This list is a compilation of technical interview questions received by members of this cohort. Feel free to add to this list.
I have attempted to classify the questions in a meaningful manner, though any suggestions are welcome.

### Vocabulary
- Define Agile (vs. waterfall?)
- Define Scrum

### Projects/Implementation
- How would you build this project?
- How would you handle user authentication (username/password)? (Answer: you don't!)
